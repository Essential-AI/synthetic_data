Eligible employees are permitted to contribute to the 401(k) Plan within statutory and 401(k) Plan limits. The Company makes matching contributions of 100% of the first 6% of employee contributions.

Commitments and ContingenciesLease Commitments The Company has historically entered into lease arrangements for its facilities. The Company has one operating lease for its office and laboratory facility with required future minimum payments. The lease does not contain any options to renew, terminate, or purchase the underlying asset. On March 31, 2021, the Company executed an amendment to the facility lease which included an extension of the expiration date of the original leased premises, the addition of 4,516 square feet of laboratory space with a commencement date of May 1, 2021, and the addition of 1,000 square feet of laboratory space with a commencement date of June 15, 2021. The lease term for the original and new spaces will expire on July 31, 2023, with an option to renew for an additional 12 months. Upon the execution of the amendment, which was deemed to be a lease modification, the Company re-evaluated the assumptions made at the original lease commencement date. The Company determined the amendment consists of two separate contracts under ASC 842. One contract is related to the modification of term for the original space, and the other is related to a new right-of-use for the two additional spaces, which are to be accounted for as new leases. The Company remeasured the lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for the original space as of the effective date of the amendment to reflect the extended term and recorded in the second quarter of 2021 an additional right-of-use asset and lease liability upon lease commencement of each of the additional space. On May 16, 2022, the Company entered into an office and laboratory lease in Boston, MA with an initial 10-year term and one renewal option to extend the lease for an additional seven years. Estimated payments due under the initial term total $35.2 million. The lease requires a letter of credit totaling $0.8 million which is classified as long-term restricted cash and deposits on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The landlord will reimburse the Company up to $0.5 million for certain costs related to expansion of the laboratory space. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has not received access to the space and construction plans have not started. In addition, as of June 30, 2020, there are no right of use assets and lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The Company has one operating lease for its office and laboratory facility with required future minimum payments. The lease does not contain any options to renew, terminate, or purchase the underlying asset. On March 31, 2021, the Company executed an amendment to the facility lease which included an extension of the expiration date of the original leased premises, the addition of 4,516 square feet of laboratory space with a commencement date of May 1, 2021, and the addition of 1,000 square feet of laboratory space with a commencement date of June 15, 2021. The lease term for the original and new spaces will expire on July 31, 2023, with an option to renew for an additional 12 months. Upon the execution of the amendment, which was deemed to be a lease modification, the Company re-evaluated the assumptions made at the original lease commencement date. The Company determined the amendment consists of two separate contracts under ASC 842. One contract is related to the modification of term for the original space, and the other"

Goodwill is mainly attributable to the enhanced value of the combined company, as reflected in the increase in market value of the resTORbio common shares following the announcement of the Merger with Former Adicet.The fair value of acquired IPR&D is related to the research and development of RTB101 for a COVID-19 related indication and was conducted pursuant to resTORbio's license agreement with Novartis (see Note 11). The RTB101 compound IPR&D project was valued using an income approach, specifically a projected discounted cash flow method, adjusted for the probability of technical success (PTS). The projected discounted cash flow models used to estimate the Company’s IPR&D reflect significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate a drug development asset, including the following:•Estimates of potential cash flows to be generated by the project and resulting asset, which was developed utilizing estimates of total patient population, market penetration rates, demand risk adjustment factors, and product pricing; •Estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs of goods sold, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses to advance the clinical programs to commercialization, cash flow adjustments and partner profit split; •The projected cash flows were then adjusted using PTS factors that were selected considering both the current state of clinical development and the nature of the proposed indication, (i.e., respiratory therapeutics); and •Finally, the resulting probability adjusted cash flows were discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate, developed considering the market risk present in the forecast and the size of the asset. This IPR&D intangible asset is not amortized, but rather is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present, until the project is completed, abandoned, or transferred to a third party. Upon the review of impairment indicators of IPR&D during the second quarter of 2021, the Company concluded that the IPR&D was fully F-18\nAdicet Bio, Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements impaired and recorded an impairment charge within research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the remaining balance of the IPR&D intangible asset June 30, 2021. The Company recognized IPR&D impairment charges of $2.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.7 million for the quarters ended as of December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021, and June 30, 2021. On July 29, 2021, the Company sent Novartis a termination notice. Termination will automatically take effect as of 60 days from the date of delivery of the termination notice to Novartis, but in no event later than October 1, 2021 without any further notice or action required of either Novartis or the Company.The contingent consideration for the CVR was valued using an income approach, leveraging the probability adjusted discounted cash flow used in the valuation of the IPR&D and then deducting the administrative fee to be retained by the combined company and other permitted deductions in order to arrive at the net cash expected to be paid out to the CVR holders. The probability adjusted cash flow includes significant estimates and assumptions pertaining to commercialization events and cash consideration received by the Company for the grant of rights to commercialize RTB101 during the term of the CVR Agreement (as discussed above). These cash flows were then discounted to present value using the same discount rate applied in the valuation of the IPR&D.Transaction costs for the Merger were $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and were expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.The following tables present changes in the Company's IPR&D and CVR since the Merger (in thousands): ",

Goodwill is mainly attributable to the enhanced value of the combined company, as reflected in the increase in market value of the resTORbio common shares following the announcement of the Merger with Former Adicet.The fair value of acquired IPR&D is related to the research and development of RTB101 for a COVID-19 related indication and was conducted pursuant to resTORbio's license agreement with Novartis (see Note 11). The RTB101 compound IPR&D project was valued using an income approach, specifically a projected discounted cash flow method, adjusted for the probability of technical success (PTS). The projected discounted cash flow models used to estimate the Company’s IPR&D reflect significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate a drug development asset, including the following:•Estimates of potential cash flows to be generated by the project and resulting asset, which was developed utilizing estimates of total patient population, market penetration rates, demand risk adjustment factors, and product pricing; •Estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs of goods sold, research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses to advance the clinical programs to commercialization, cash flow adjustments and partner profit split; •The projected cash flows were then adjusted using PTS factors that were selected considering both the current state of clinical development and the nature of the proposed indication, (i.e., respiratory therapeutics); and •Finally, the resulting probability adjusted cash flows were discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate, developed considering the market risk present in the forecast and the size of the asset. This IPR&D intangible asset is not amortized, but rather is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present, until the project is completed, abandoned, or transferred to a third party. Upon the review of impairment indicators of IPR&D during the second quarter of 2021, the Company concluded that the IPR&D was fully F-18\nAdicet Bio, Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements impaired and recorded an impairment charge within research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the remaining balance of the IPR&D intangible asset June 30, 2021. The Company recognized IPR&D impairment charges of $2.3 million, $0.5 million, and $0.7 million for the quarters ended as of December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021, and June 30, 2021. On July 29, 2021, the Company sent Novartis a termination notice. Termination will automatically take effect as of 60 days from the date of delivery of the termination notice to Novartis, but in no event later than October 1, 2021 without any further notice or action required of either Novartis or the Company.The contingent consideration for the CVR was valued using an income approach, leveraging the probability adjusted discounted cash flow used in the valuation of the IPR&D and then deducting the administrative fee to be retained by the combined company and other permitted deductions in order to arrive at the net cash expected to be paid out to the CVR holders. The probability adjusted cash flow includes significant estimates and assumptions pertaining to commercialization events and cash consideration received by the Company for the grant of rights to commercialize RTB101 during the term of the CVR Agreement (as discussed above). These cash flows were then discounted to present value using the same discount rate applied in the valuation of the IPR&D.Transaction costs for the Merger were $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and were expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.The following tables present changes in the Company's IPR&D and CVR since the Merger (in thousands): '."

The expected volatility as of the Initial Public Offering date was derived from observable public warrant pricing on comparable ‘blank-check’ companies without an identified target. The subsequent measurements of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units on September 14, 2020, were classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units, the close price of the Public Warrant price will be used as the fair value as of each relevant date. The Private Warrants are considered to be a Level 2 fair value measurement and are valued the same as the Public Warrants even though they are not traded on the market.

The favorable development reduced loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by $38.9 million and $34.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The revisions to the Company’s reserves reflect new information gained by claims adjusters in the normal course of adjusting claims and is reflected in the financial statements when the information becomes available.

Related Party TransactionsBeginning February 2023, an officer of the Company has served as a member of the board of directors of a client of the Company. The Company recognized $1.2 million and $3.2 million of revenues from such client during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Accounts receivable from this client were $0.6 million as of September 30, 2023. Beginning July 2023, a member of the board of directors of the Company has served as an officer of a client of the Company. The Company recognized $4.0 million of revenues from such client during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Accounts receivable from this client were $2.6 million as of September 30, 2023. Investment in Unconsolidated AffiliatesDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenues of $6.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, from a parent company of an unconsolidated affiliate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenues of $15.2 million and $11.1 million, respectively, from the parent company of an unconsolidated affiliate. Accounts receivable from the parent company of an unconsolidated affiliate were $2.8 million and $1.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n \n7. Income TaxesThe Company’s effective tax rates were 16.1% and 4.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate is based upon the estimated income or loss before taxes for the year, by jurisdiction, and adjusted for estimated permanent tax adjustments. The fluctuation in the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily due to the three month pretax book income/loss differences and the remeasurement of deferred tax liability of $5.0 million due to the state tax rate change for the three months ended September 30, 2022.The Company’s effective tax rates were 13.7% and 20.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fluctuation in the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily due to a difference in projected book income/loss used in the annual effective tax rate, the nine month pretax book income/loss differences, the application of the shortfall of $4.5 million of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the shortfall of $2.4 million of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and the remeasurement of deferred tax liability of $5.0 million due to the state tax rate change for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\n8. SegmentsThe Company’s operations are organized into two reportable segments: sales and marketing. The operating segments reported below are the segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (i.e., the Company’s Chief Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Through the Company’s sales segment, the Company serves as a strategic intermediary between consumer goods manufacturers and retailer partners and performs critical merchandising services on behalf of both consumer goods manufacturers and retailer partners. Through the Company’s marketing segment, the Company develops and executes marketing programs for consumer goods manufacturers and retailers. These reportable segments are organized by the types of services provided, similar economic characteristics, and how the Company manages its business. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; therefore, no additional information is produced or included herein. The Company and its chief operating decision maker evaluate performance based on revenues and operating (loss) income. 15\n  ",

Through the Company’s sales segment, the Company serves as a strategic intermediary between consumer goods manufacturers and retailer partners and performs critical merchandising services on behalf of both consumer goods manufacturers and retailer partners. Through the Company’s marketing segment, the Company develops and executes marketing programs for consumer goods manufacturers and retailers. These reportable segments are organized by the types of services provided, similar economic characteristics, and how the Company manages its business. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; therefore, no additional information is produced or included herein. The Company and its chief operating decision maker evaluate performance based on revenues and operating (loss) income. 15\n  '.",

During the three months ended January 26,\n2003, Applied repurchased 3,073,000 shares of its common\nstock at an average price of $16.25 for a cash outlay of\n$50 million.\n\n\n(10) Notes Payable\n     \nApplied has credit facilities for unsecured\nborrowings in various currencies up to approximately\n$674 million, of which $500 million is comprised of\ntwo revolving credit agreements in the United States with a\ngroup of banks. One agreement is a $250 million line of\ncredit that expires in September 2004, and is expected to be\nrenewed, and the other is a $250 million line of credit\nthat expires in September 2006. The agreements provide for\nborrowings at various rates, including the lead bank’s\nprime reference rate, and include financial and other covenants\nwith which Applied was in compliance as of October 26, 2003\nand February 1, 2004. No amounts were outstanding under\nthese agreements as of October 26, 2003 and\nFebruary 1, 2004. The remaining credit facilities of\napproximately $174 million are with Japanese banks at rates\nindexed to their prime reference rate and are denominated in\nJapanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under Japanese credit\nfacilities as of October 26, 2003 and February 1, 2004.\n\n\n(11) Business Combination\n     \nOn April 18, 2003, Applied acquired Boxer\nCross, Inc., a producer of in-line monitoring systems that\nprovide customers with critical electrical measurement data for\ncontrolling semiconductor processes, for $14 million in\ncash. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded\ngoodwill of $18 million, net of adjustments to the initial\npurchase price allocation, and purchased technology of\n$3 million,partially offset by other items of\n$7 million, primarily for net liabilities assumed upon\nacquisition. The in-process research and development expense was\ninsignificant.\n\n     \nFor the purchase business combination discussed\nabove, the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates\nwere not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the\nperiods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is\nreviewed periodically for impairment, and purchased technology\nis amortized over its useful life of five to 10 years.\nAcquisitions have not had, and are not expected to have, a\nmaterial effect on Applied’s financial condition or results\nof operations.\n\n\n(12) Recent Accounting\nPronouncements\n     \nOn December 17, 2003, the Staff of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Staff) issued\nStaff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue\nRecognition” (SAB 104), which supercedes Staff\nAccounting Bulletin No. 101 “Revenue Recognition in\nFinancial Statements” (SAB 101). SAB 104 rescinds\naccounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to\nmultiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of\nthe issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21\n(EITF 00-21), “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements\nwith Multiple Deliverables.” Additionally, SAB 104\nrescinds the SEC’s Revenue Recognition in Financial\nStatements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (the FAQ)\nissued with SAB 101 that had\n\n11\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\n\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)\n\nbeen codified in SEC topic 13, “Revenue\nRecognition”. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed\nto reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue\nrecognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged\nby the issuance of SAB 104. Applied does not expect the\nadoption of SAB 104 to have a material effect on its\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\n\n12\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n '.",

      "text_section": "\n\n\n\nItem 4.\n\nControls and Procedures\n\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q, we revised our prior position on accounting for warrants. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, solely due to the Company’s restatement of its financial statements to reclassify the Company’s warrants, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2021.\n \nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the evaluation of the SEC’s recent statement regarding SPAC accounting matters and management’s subsequent re-evaluation of its previously issued financial statements, the Company determined that there were errors in its accounting for its warrants. Management concluded that a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting existed relating to the accounting treatment for complex financial instruments and that the failure to properly account for such instruments constituted a material weakness as defined in the SEC regulations. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company’s audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2020.\n \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In light of the restatement of our financial statements included in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, we plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.\n22\n\n \nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION",

In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report Form 10-Q, we revised our prior position on accounting for warrants. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, solely due to the Company’s restatement of its financial statements to reclassify the Company’s warrants, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2021.\n \nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the evaluation of the SEC’s recent statement regarding SPAC accounting matters and management’s subsequent re-evaluation of its previously issued financial statements, the Company determined that there were errors in its accounting for its warrants. Management concluded that a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting existed relating to the accounting treatment for complex financial instruments and that the failure to properly account for such instruments constituted a material weakness as defined in the SEC regulations. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company’s audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2020.\n \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In light of the restatement of our financial statements included in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, we plan to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.\n22\n\n \nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION'."

A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial\nstatements.  Foreign Currency \nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and\nuse hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.\n Interest Rate  Our fixed-income\nportfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain\nglobal and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. \nEquity  Our equity portfolio consists of\nglobal, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.\n Commodity  We use broad-based\ncommodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global\ncommodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices.  VALUE-AT-RISK \nWe use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level,\nin the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange\nrates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.  The VaR is calculated as the total loss\nthat will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases.

In our opinion, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.  \n\n\n \n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2018 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 11, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n\n \n\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\n\n \n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\n\n \n\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n \n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\n\n \n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Direct costs for our EFX program decreased $5.9 million, attributed primarily to a $11.1 million increase in CRO expenses related to our ongoing HARMONY and SYMMETRY clinical trials offset by a $16.6 million decrease in third-party contract manufacturing expenses for EFX and a $0.4 million decrease in other research and development costs. Personnel and other research and development related expenses increased $9.5 million, due to a $5.0 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $4.4 million increase in other R&D, wage and wage-related expenses resulting from increased staff. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned manufacturing and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future to support the ongoing programs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $29.9 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $10.7 million which was due primarily to a $8.1 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $2.6 increase in other expenses and wage and wage-related expenses resulting from increased staff. \nInterest expense \nInterest expense the year ended December 31, 2022 is comprised primarily of $0.7 million of interest expense related to the Hercules term loan.\nInterest and other income \nInterest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2022 is comprised primarily of $3.9 million of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities compared to $0.1 million for the \n105\n\nTable of Contents \nyear ended December 31, 2021. This increase is related to increased investment returns on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and marketable securities.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2023, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any products and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of products for several years, if at all. Through December 31, 2023, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, the initial public offering of our common stock in June 2019, and follow-on public offerings of our common stock in July 2020 and in September 2022. In June 2022, we received $25.0 million from an equity investment from Pfizer, Inc. and $10.0 million from a Term Loan provided by Hercules. An additional $15.0 million was borrowed from Hercules in March of 2023. In April and May 2023, we received gross proceeds of $127.4 million in an ATM offering and gross proceeds of $220.0 million from the sale of common stock in an underwritten registered direct offering. From our inception through December 31, 2023, these and other funding sources have provided gross proceeds totaling $1,040.2 million.

DSO is derived by dividing our average patient accounts receivable for the fiscal period by our average daily revenue for the fiscal period. The timing of billing and collecting on our receivables can be affected by many factors, including the annual revalidation of third-party insurance in our PDS business which typically occurs in the first quarter of each year; pre-claim reviews and post-claim reviews associated with \n32\n \n\n \nMedicare's Review Choice Demonstration Program; acquisition and system transition activities; among other things. The collection cycle for the businesses within our HHH segment is also generally longer than the businesses within our PDS segment, primarily due to longer billing cycles for HHH, which is generally billed in thirty day increments. The following table presents our trailing five quarter consolidated DSO for the respective periods:\n '.",

Gross profit is the most comparable GAAP measurement, which is calculated as revenue less platform operations costs. In calculating Adjusted Gross Profit, we add back other platform operations costs, which consist of amortization expense related to capitalized software, depreciation expense, allocated costs of personnel which set up and monitor campaign performance, and platform hosting, license, and maintenance costs, to gross profit.\nThe following table presents the calculation of gross profit and reconciliation of gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n ",

We may also purchase or short TBA and\nU.S. Treasury securities, purchase or write put or call options on TBA securities or we may invest in other types of mortgage derivative securities, such as interest-only securities, and synthetic total return swaps, such as the IOS Index. Our risk\nmanagement strategy attempts to manage the overall risk of the portfolio, reduce fluctuations in book value and generate additional income distributable to stockholders. For additional information regarding our derivative instruments and our overall\nrisk management strategy, please refer to the discussion of derivative and other hedging instruments in Note 3.  As of\nJune 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, our derivative and other hedging instruments were comprised primarily of interest rate swaps, which have the effect of modifying the repricing characteristics of our repurchase agreements and cash flows\non such liabilities. Our interest rate swaps are used to manage the interest \n  19 \n\n\n\nrate risk created by our variable rate short-term repurchase agreements. Under our interest rate swaps, we typically pay a fixed-rate and receive a floating rate based on one-month LIBOR with\nterms usually ranging up to 5 years. Our interest rate swaps are generally designated as cash flow hedges under ASC 815. \nDerivative and other hedging instruments entered into in addition to interest rate swap agreements are intended to supplement our use of\ninterest rate swaps and we do not currently expect our use of these instruments to be the primary protection against interest rate risk for our portfolio. These instruments are accounted for as either derivatives, but are not typically designated as\nhedges under ASC 815, or trading securities. Therefore, any changes in the fair values of the contracts prior to their settlement date are included in earnings. We do not use derivative or other hedging instruments for speculative purposes.\n Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments  As of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we had net interest rate swap liabilities of $233.1 million and $37.7 million, respectively. The tables below summarize information about our\noutstanding interest rate swaps as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):   ",

      "text_section": " \nThe fair value of the Prefunded Warrants (as defined in the “Securities Purchase Agreement and Warrants” section of this Quarterly Report) and stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the Company’s common stock offering on  March 1, 2022 were measured using the Black-Scholes model. Due to the complexity of the warrants issued, the Company uses an outside expert to assist in providing the mark-to-market fair valuation of the liabilities over the reporting periods in which the original agreement was in effect. Inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities include the fair value of the underlying stock at the valuation date, the term of the warrants, and the expected volatility of the underlying stock. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities is the estimated term of the warrants.

The company remeasures the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period, and any changes in fair value resulting from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date, such as changes in discount rates, or in the expectations of achieving the performance targets, are recorded within “change in fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities” on the statement of operations.\n \nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:\n \nLevel 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n \nLevel 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n \nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data for the related assets or liabilities.\n ",

      "text_section": "\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n     \n  \nNote 12.  Convertible Senior Notes\n​\nOn  March 5, 2019, the Company issued $80.5 million of 5% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of  March 5, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, paying agent, and conversion agent (the “Trustee”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on  March 15 and  September 15 of each year, beginning on  September 15, 2019. The Notes will mature on  March 15, 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms.\n​\nThe sale of the Notes generated net proceeds of $76.4 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $37.8 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fully repay the CapEx Loan and Term Loan with Truist Bank and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes.\n​\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the Notes for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n​\n   September 30,    December 31,  \n ​   2020    2019  \n Principal  $80,500  $80,500 \n Unamortized debt issuance costs   (2,854)  (3,459)\n Net carrying amount  $77,646  $77,041 \n\n​\nThe Notes are convertible at the option of holders of the Notes at any time until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive shares of the Company’s common stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at the then-applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 56.9801 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (representing an initial conversion price of approximately $17.55 per share of common stock, which represents an initial conversion premium of approximately 30% above the closing price of $13.50 per share of the Company’s common stock on  February 28, 2019), subject to customary adjustments. If a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, and in connection with certain other conversions before  March 15, 2022, the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.\n \nInitially there are no guarantors of the Notes, but the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s future domestic subsidiaries.  The Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness.  The Note Guarantee (as defined in the Indenture) of each future guarantor, if any, will be such guarantor’s senior, unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to such future guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to such future guarantor’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness.\n \nHolders  may require the Company to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash purchase price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\n \nThe Company  may not redeem the Notes prior to  March 15, 2022.  On or after  March 15, 2022, the Company  may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such redemption notice.  The redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.  In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n ",

The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of  March 5, 2019 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, paying agent, and conversion agent (the “Trustee”). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on  March 15 and  September 15 of each year, beginning on  September 15, 2019. The Notes will mature on  March 15, 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms.\n​\nThe sale of the Notes generated net proceeds of $76.4 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $37.8 million of the net proceeds from the offering to fully repay the CapEx Loan and Term Loan with Truist Bank and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes.\n​\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the Notes for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n​\n   September 30,    December 31,  \n ​   2020    2019  \n Principal  $80,500  $80,500 \n Unamortized debt issuance costs   (2,854)  (3,459)\n Net carrying amount  $77,646  $77,041 \n\n​\nThe Notes are convertible at the option of holders of the Notes at any time until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive shares of the Company’s common stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at the then-applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 56.9801 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (representing an initial conversion price of approximately $17.55 per share of common stock, which represents an initial conversion premium of approximately 30% above the closing price of $13.50 per share of the Company’s common stock on  February 28, 2019), subject to customary adjustments. If a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, and in connection with certain other conversions before  March 15, 2022, the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.\n \nInitially there are no guarantors of the Notes, but the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of the Company’s future domestic subsidiaries.  The Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness.  The Note Guarantee (as defined in the Indenture) of each future guarantor, if any, will be such guarantor’s senior, unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment with existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to such future guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes and effectively subordinated to such future guarantor’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness.\n \nHolders  may require the Company to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash purchase price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\n \nThe Company  may not redeem the Notes prior to  March 15, 2022.  On or after  March 15, 2022, the Company  may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such redemption notice.  The redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.  In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n '."

The purported securities class action lawsuits asserted that the defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and alleged that the defendants who are no longer at Adverum made materially false and misleading statements and omitted allegedly material information related to, among other things, the Phase 2a clinical trial for AVA-101, a program which has been discontinued, and the prospects of AVA-101. We settled these lawsuits for $13.0 million, of which $1.0 million we contributed to cover our indemnification obligations to the underwriters, and the remainder was contributed by our insurers.

      "text_section": "\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\n\n\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.\n\n\n\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security “CARES” Act into law. The CARES Act includes several significant business tax provisions that, among other things, would eliminate the taxable income limit for certain net operating losses (“NOL”) and allow businesses to carry back NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the five prior years, suspend the excess business loss rules, accelerate refunds of previously generated corporate alternative minimum tax credits, generally loosen the business interest limitation under IRC section 163(j) from 30 percent to 50 percent among other technical corrections included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax provisions. The Company does not believe that the CARES Act will have a significant impact on Company’s financial position or statement of operations.\n\n\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\n\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.\n\n\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n\n\nRecent Accounting Standards\n\n\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s condensed financial statements.\n\n\n\nNote 3 – Initial Public Offering\n\n\n\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 22,052,077 units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). On May 20, 2020, 7,126,888 shares were redeemed.  On October 20, 2020, 5,864,053 shares were redeemed.",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\n\n\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.\n\n\n\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security “CARES” Act into law. The CARES Act includes several significant business tax provisions that, among other things, would eliminate the taxable income limit for certain net operating losses (“NOL”) and allow businesses to carry back NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the five prior years, suspend the excess business loss rules, accelerate refunds of previously generated corporate alternative minimum tax credits, generally loosen the business interest limitation under IRC section 163(j) from 30 percent to 50 percent among other technical corrections included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax provisions. The Company does not believe that the CARES Act will have a significant impact on Company’s financial position or statement of operations.\n\n\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\n\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000.

Research and development expense was $37.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared with $45.4 million in the comparable period last year, primarily reflecting decreased manufacturing costs of $10.9 million offset by an increase of $2.3 million in personnel related expenses and an increase of facilities expense of $0.7 million. Research and development expense was $120.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared with $141.1 million in the comparable period last year, primarily attributable to decreases in clinical and manufacturing costs of $27.3 million and lab supplies of $4.0 million, offset by increases in personnel costs of $7.7 million and facilities and equipment costs of $2.7 million and a decrease in contra research and development expenses $1.4 million. We expect that our research and development efforts and associated costs will increase and continue to be substantial over the next several years as our pipeline progresses.\nEarly stage programs represent programs that are in the pre-clinical or Phase 1 clinical stage and may be partnered or unpartnered, including the CF program. Discovery technologies represents our efforts to expand our product pipeline and are primarily related to pre-partnered studies and new capabilities assessment. For several of our programs, the activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships and the expenses may be partially offset with funds that have been awarded to the Company. The expenses primarily consist of external manufacturing costs, lab supplies, equipment, and consulting and professional fees. Both early stage programs and discovery technologies expenses are expected to steadily increase over the coming years. \nPersonnel related expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits, share-based compensation and consultants and are expected to continue to increase in the near future as we continue increase headcount to meet the needs of our external pipeline, platform and clinical trial efforts. Additionally, personnel related expenses will continue to rise as we increase salaries in line with increases in the market rates in order to retain our employees. \nFacilities and equipment expenses continue to increase as we expand. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes increased rent and associated costs related to a new facility we took possession of in April 2022. Facilities and equipment expenses are expected to increase in the near term due to increased rent expense related to our new facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related benefits for our executive, administrative, legal and accounting functions and professional service fees for legal and accounting services as well as other general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expense was $12.5 million and $34.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared with $10.9 million and $30.6 million in the comparable periods last year. The increases resulted primarily from personnel expense due to increased headcount and salaries, as well as increased rent expense associated with the new facility.\n22\n\n \nFinance (expense) income, net\n ",

Discovery technologies represents our efforts to expand our product pipeline and are primarily related to pre-partnered studies and new capabilities assessment. For several of our programs, the activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships and the expenses may be partially offset with funds that have been awarded to the Company. The expenses primarily consist of external manufacturing costs, lab supplies, equipment, and consulting and professional fees. Both early stage programs and discovery technologies expenses are expected to steadily increase over the coming years. \nPersonnel related expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits, share-based compensation and consultants and are expected to continue to increase in the near future as we continue increase headcount to meet the needs of our external pipeline, platform and clinical trial efforts. Additionally, personnel related expenses will continue to rise as we increase salaries in line with increases in the market rates in order to retain our employees. \nFacilities and equipment expenses continue to increase as we expand. The nine months ended September 30, 2022 includes increased rent and associated costs related to a new facility we took possession of in April 2022. Facilities and equipment expenses are expected to increase in the near term due to increased rent expense related to our new facility.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related benefits for our executive, administrative, legal and accounting functions and professional service fees for legal and accounting services as well as other general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expense was $12.5 million and $34.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared with $10.9 million and $30.6 million in the comparable periods last year. The increases resulted primarily from personnel expense due to increased headcount and salaries, as well as increased rent expense associated with the new facility.\n22\n\n \nFinance (expense) income, net\n '."

We evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis. Significant management judgment is involved in\ndetermining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Due to uncertainties with respect to the realization of our deferred tax assets due to our history\nof operating losses, a valuation allowance has been established against our deferred tax asset balances to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a result we have fully reserved against the\ndeferred tax asset balances. The valuation allowances are based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ\nfrom these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, a change in the valuation allowance may be needed, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Our deferred tax assets primarily consist of net\noperating loss (NOL) carry-forwards. At December 31, 2011 we had federal NOL carry-forwards of approximately $120.4 million and state NOL carry-forwards of approximately $103.8 million, respectively, that are available to reduce future income\notherwise taxable. If not utilized, the federal NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2031 and the state NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2020 and 2031. We periodically evaluate our NOL\ncarry-forwards and whether certain changes in ownership, including our IPO, have occurred that would limit our ability to utilize a portion of our NOL carry-forwards. If it is determined that significant ownership changes have occurred since these\nNOLs were generated, we may be subject to annual limitations on the use of these NOLs under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 (or comparable provisions of state law). We have not performed a formal analysis of our NOLs in connection with\nIRC Section 382.  In the event that we were to determine that we are able to realize any of our net deferred tax assets in the\nfuture, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made. We believe that the most significant uncertainty that will impact the determination of our valuation allowance will be our\nestimation of the extent and timing of future net income, if any.  We considered our income tax positions for uncertainty in\naccordance with ASC 740. We believe our income tax filing positions and deductions are more likely than not of being sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position; therefore,\nwe have not recorded ASC 740 liabilities. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively, in our statements of operations.

Under the terms of its overnight air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations, consisting principally of fuel, crew and other direct operating costs, and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed by its customer.  Significant increases in inflation rates could, however, have a material impact on future revenue and operating income.\n \nSeasonality\n \nGGS’s business has historically been seasonal.  The Company has continued its efforts to reduce GGS’s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year.  In June 1999, GGS was awarded a four-year contract to supply deicing equipment to the United States Air Force, and subsequently was awarded two three-year extensions on the contract, which expired in June 2009.  In July 2009, GGS was awarded a new one-year contract with the United States Air Force with four additional one-year extension options.  Although sales remain somewhat seasonal, particularly with regard to commercial deicers which typically are delivered prior to the winter season, this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts in the past when sales under the contract with the United States Air Force were a significant component of the Company's revenues.  If sales to the United States Air Force do not continue to be a significant component of GGS’s sales, seasonal patterns of revenues and earnings attributable to its commercial deicer business may resume.  The overnight air cargo and ground support services segments are not susceptible to seasonal trends.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions.  The Company’s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change.  Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from estimates.  The Company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies:\n \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts.  An allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on management’s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable.  The required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history, industry information, credit reports, customer financial condition and the collectability of outstanding accounts receivables.  The estimates can be affected by changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry, customer credit issues or general economic conditions.\n \nInventories.  The Company’s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are based on assessment of the marketability of slow-moving and obsolete inventories.  Historical parts usage, current period sales, estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates.  Estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization, existing supplies of used inventory available for sale, the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry.\n \nWarranty Reserves.  The Company warranties its ground equipment products for up to a three-year period from date of sale.  Product warranty reserves are recorded at time of sale based on the historical average warranty cost and are adjusted as actual warranty cost becomes known.\n \nIncome Taxes.  Income taxes have been provided using the liability method.  Deferred income taxes reflect the net affects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse.\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n15",

The warrant liabilities were measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statements of operations.  Upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Public Warrants and a modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of Units (which is inclusive of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one Public Warrant) and (ii) the sale of Private Warrants, first to the warrants based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption (temporary equity) based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date. The Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the issuance due to the use of unobservable inputs.  As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Public Warrants were valued using the publicly available price for the Warrant and are classified as Level 1 on the Fair Value Hierarchy. The Company relied upon the implied volatility of the Public Warrants and the implied volatilities of comparable companies and the closing price as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 per Public Warrant to estimate the volatility for the Private Placement Warrants. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Private Placement Warrants were classified within Level 3 of the Fair Value Hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs. The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the three months ended March 31, 2023:    15           Table of Contents   ",

The previous legislation expired in September 2009 and the highway fund operated under continuation bills at the previously approved funding levels until April 2010 when a new short-term bill funding the 2010 calendar y\near was passed.  International sales increased primarily in Canada, the West Indies, Africa and South America while decreasing in Central America and Asia.  Parts sales for the Asphalt Group increased 6.9% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.\n\n\nAggregate and Mining Group: Sales in this group were $67,000,000 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $55,452,000 for the same period in 2009, an increase of  $11,548,000 or 20.8%.  Domestic sales for the Aggregate and Mining Group increased $11,281,000 or 50.0% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The primary driver of this increase was increased road building activity during the second quarter of 2010 plus a 21.5% increase in parts sales.  International sales for the Aggregate and Mining Group were relatively flat with 2009 increasing $267,000 or 0.8% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  The increase in international sales occurred primarily in Canada, South America and Central America.  These increases were offset by\n decreases in Asia, the Middle East, China and Africa.\n\n\nMobile Asphalt Paving Group: Sales in this group were $47,231,000 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $36,859,000 for the same period in 2009, an increase of $10,372,000 or 28.1%.  Domestic sales for the Mobile Asphalt Paving Group increased $5,093,000 or 17.4% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  The increase in domestic sales is primarily due to the federal stimulus package, which funded highway resurfacing projects.  International sales for the Mobile Asphalt Paving Group increased $5,279,000 or 70.1% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, due partially to the adoption of infrastructure stimulus plans by certain foreign countries.  The increase internationally occurred primarily in Canada, Europe and Central America.  \n;Parts sales for this group decreased 1.2% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.\n\n\nUnderground Group: Sales in this group were $13,636,000 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $17,145,000 for the same period in 2009, a decrease of $3,509,000 or 20.5%.  Domestic sales for the Underground Group increased $433,000 or 5.3% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  International sales for the Underground Group decreased $3,942,000 or 44.0% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  The decrease in international sales occurred in Canada and the Middle East.  The decrease in international sales is primarily due to weakness in pipeline and utility construction in certain foreign markets.  Parts sales for the Underground Group increased 18.1% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n23",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Each Public Unit consists of one Public Share and one Class 1 Warrant and one-half of one Class 2 Warrant. The Company will not issue fractional shares. As a result, the warrants must be exercised in multiples of one whole warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of the Company’s Public Share at a price of $11.50 per share, and only whole warrants are exercisable. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the IPO, and will (except for Class 2Warrants embedded in the Public Shares that are redeemed prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, which Class 2 Warrants will expire upon redemption of such shares) expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. As a result, if the public shareholders redeem their Public Shares prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the embedded Class 2 Warrants will expire. The Class 1 and Class 2 warrants have similar terms, except that the Class 1 Warrants separated and began separately trading on the 52nd day following the effective date of the IPO. The New Units resulting from such separation (each such New Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one Class 2 Warrant) will not separate into Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants until consummation of the initial Business Combination. All of the 8,050,000 public shares sold as part of the Public Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or in connection with the Company’s liquidation. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. The Company’s redeemable ordinary shares is subject to SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. The Company’s redeemable ordinary shares is subject to SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).  As of December 31, 2022, the ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table.  '.",

The segment’s operating results will continue to be impacted by further changes in fuel prices and the related fuel surcharges.\n\n\n \n\n\nLabor Costs \n\n\nOur Asset-Based labor costs, including retirement and healthcare benefits for contractual employees that are provided by a number of multiemployer plans, are impacted by contractual obligations under the ABF NMFA and other related supplemental agreements. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense of the Asset-Based segment amounted to 56.0% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 60.2% for the same period of 2017. Changes in salaries, wages, and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue are discussed in the following Asset-Based Segment Results section.\n\n\n \n\n\nABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. Nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure. During negotiations for the tentative contract agreement, ABF Freight continued to address with the IBT the effect of the segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe combined effect of cost reductions under the ABF NMFA that is currently in effect, lowered cost increases throughout the contract period, and increased flexibility in labor work rules were important factors in bringing ABF Freight’s labor cost structure closer in line with that of its competitors; however, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry. These rates include contributions to multiemployer plans, a portion of which are used to fund benefits for individuals who were never employed by ABF Freight. Information provided by a large multiemployer pension plan to which ABF Freight contributes indicates that approximately 50% of the plan’s benefit payments are made to retirees of companies that are no longer contributing employers to that plan. In consideration of the impact of high multiemployer pension contribution rates, certain funds have not increased ABF Freight’s pension contribution rate for the annual contribution period which began August 1, 2017. Rate freezes for the annual contribution period which began August 1, 2017 impacted multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight made approximately 70% of its total multiemployer pension contributions for the year ended December 31, 2017. Including the effect of these rate freezes, the average health, welfare, and pension benefit contribution rate increased approximately 2.8% and 2.0% effective primarily on August 1, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Effective July 1, 2017, the ABF NMFA contractual wage rate increased 2.5%. As previously outlined, the tentative contract agreement provides for ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans to remain at the rates currently being paid under the ABF NMFA that is currently in effect, while wage rates and health and welfare contribution rates for most plans would increase annually in accordance with the terms of the tentative contract agreement once ratified.\n\n\n \n\n\nSome employer companies that participate in multiemployer plans, in which ABF Freight also participates, have received proposals from, and entered into transition agreements with, certain multiemployer plans to restructure future plan contributions to be more in line with benefit levels. These transition agreements, which require mutual agreement of numerous elements between the multiemployer plan and the contributing employer, may also result in recognition of significant withdrawal liabilities. We monitor and evaluate any such proposals we receive, including the potential economic impact to our business. At the current time, there are no proposals that have been provided to ABF Freight that management considers acceptable. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38\n\n \n\nTable of Contents",

Following ratification of the supplements to the contract, the 2018 ABF NMFA was implemented on July 29, 2018, effective retroactive to April 1, 2018, and will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. \n\n\n \n\n\nUnder the 2018 ABF NMFA, the contractual wage and benefits costs, including the ratification bonuses and vacation restoration, are estimated to increase approximately 2.0% on a compounded annual basis through the end of the agreement.\n\n\nThe major economic provisions of the 2018 ABF NMFA include:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\nrestoration of one week of vacation which begins accruing on anniversary dates on or after April 1, 2018, with the new vacation eligibility schedule being the same as the applicable 2008 to 2013 supplemental agreements;\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\nwage increases in each year of the contract, beginning July 1, 2018;\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\nratification bonuses for qualifying employees;\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\ncontributions to multiemployer pension plans at current rates for each fund;\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\ncontinuation of existing health coverage and annual multiemployer health and welfare contribution rate increases in accordance with the contract;\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\nchanges to purchased transportation provisions with certain protections for road drivers as specified in the contract; and\n\n\n ·\n\n\n\nprofit-sharing bonuses upon the Asset-Based segment’s achievement of annual operating ratios of 96.0% or below for a full calendar year under the contract period.\n\n \n\n\nOn July 9, 2018, ABF Freight reached a tentative agreement with the Teamster bargaining representatives for the Northern and Southern New England Supplemental Agreements on terms for new supplemental agreements for 2018-2023 (the “New England Supplemental Agreements”). The New England Supplemental Agreements were ratified by the local unions in the region covered by the supplements on July 25, 2018. In accordance with the New England Supplemental Agreements, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension plan obligation with the New England Pension Fund was restructured under a transition agreement effective on August 1, 2018. The transition agreement resulted in ABF Freight’s withdrawal as a participating employer in the New England Pension Fund and triggered settlement of the related withdrawal liability.

The withdrawal liability was partially settled through the initial lump sum cash payment of $15.1 million made in third quarter 2018, and the remainder will be settled with monthly payments to the New England Pension Fund over a period of 23 years with an initial aggregate present value of $22.8 million. In accordance with current tax law, these payments are deductible for income taxes when paid. This transition agreement allowed ABF Freight to satisfy its withdrawal liability obligations to the existing employer pool of the New England Pension Fund to which it had historically been a participant; will minimize the potential for future increases in withdrawal liability and contribution rates; and will reduce operating costs and improve cash flow in future periods. ABF Freight transitioned to the new employer pool of the New England Pension Fund at a lower pension contribution rate, which is frozen for a period of 10 years, compared to its pension contribution rate under the previous employer pool.

Generate a new question for company 'AWH' in year '2002' which can be answered by the extracted span '\n\n\n \nshipping the ProteinChip System, Series PBS II, the current version of\n\nwhich is now referred to as the ProteinChip Biology System.\n \nIn 1999, we invested $315,000 for 30% ownership of\n\nCiphergen Biosystems KK, a joint venture we established with Sumitomo\n\nCorporation to distribute our products in Japan.  In August 2002, we exercised our \n\nright to purchase an additional 40% at a cost of approximately $446,000,\n\nnot including cash acquired in the business combination.\n \nCiphergen has offered SELDI-based research services to\n\ncustomers on request as part of its business plan since 1997. During 2000, we\n\nbegan systematically offering such research services to customers generally and\n\nhave established Biomarker Discovery Centers in Fremont, California;\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark; and Malvern, Pennsylvania as part of an expanded\n\ncommitment to the services aspect of Ciphergen’s business.\n \nIn December 2001 we introduced the ProteinChip\n\nBiomarker System, which utilizes sophisticated third party software that\n\nautomates pattern recognition-based statistical analysis methods to correlate\n\nprotein expression patterns from clinical samples with disease phenotypes. We\n\nalso began selling the Biomek 2000 Workstation, a robotic accessory which is\n\nmanufactured by Beckman Coulter and which has been optimized for use with our\n\nProteinChip Biomarker System to increase sample throughput and reproducibility.\n\nIn addition, we expanded our product offering with a SELDI ProteinChip\n\ninterface to high-end tandem mass spectrometers, which we developed and which\n\nis manufactured for us by a third party manufacturing company in Reno, Nevada.\n \nOn July 31, 2001, Ciphergen acquired the BioSepra\n\nprocess chromatography business from Invitrogen Corporation for $12.0 million\n\nin cash and the assumption of approximately $2.2 million in debt. BioSepra\n\nS.A., headquartered near Paris, France, has 50 employees who develop,\n\nmanufacture and market products for the large-scale process chromatography\n\nmarket. We have been integrating the BioSepra business into our sales and\n\nmarketing organization, and have initiated a joint development program for a\n\nline of products to address process proteomics, an emerging market driven by\n\npharmaceutical company demand to produce proteins for research, development and\n\ntherapeutic manufacturing purposes.\n \nIn October 2002, we introduced the ProteinChip\n\nAutoBiomarker System, a ProteinChip Biomarker System which includes an\n\nAutoloader for automated processing of arrays.\n \nSince 1997, we have used our resources primarily to\n\ndevelop and expand our proprietary ProteinChip Systems and establish a\n\nmarketing and sales organization for commercialization of our products. In\n\naddition, we have used our resources to establish Biomarker Discovery Centers\n\nto provide research services to our clients and to foster further adoption of\n\nour products and technology. We are also developing a chromatography-based\n\nprotein purification business based on integrating Ciphergen and BioSepra\n\nproducts and services, which expands our current proteomics business. Since our\n\ninception we have incurred significant losses and as of September 30, 2002, we\n\nhad an accumulated deficit of $97.1 million.\n \nWe anticipate that our quarterly results of operations\n\nwill fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, including\n\nmarket acceptance of current and new products, the length of the sales cycle\n\nand timing of significant orders, the timing and results of our research and\n\ndevelopment efforts, the introduction of new products by our competitors and possible\n\npatent or license issues. These factors make accurate prediction of future\n\nresults of operations difficult or impossible.\n \nCompetition in our existing and potential markets is\n\nintense and we expect it to increase. Currently, our principal competition\n\ncomes from other technologies that are used to perform many of the same\n\nfunctions for which we market our ProteinChip Systems.

U.S. currency is Level 1 and cash equivalents are Level 2.\n \nSecurities\n \nThe fair values of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific security but rather by relying on the security’s relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. The Corporation uses an independent service provider to provide matrix pricing, and uses the valuation of another provider to compare for reasonableness.\n \nLoans Held for Sale (Carried at Lower of Cost or Fair Value)\n \nThe fair values of mortgage loans held for sale are determined based on amounts to be received at settlement by establishing the respective buyer requirement or market interest rates.\n \nLoans (Carried at Cost)\n \nThe fair values of non-impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with the exit pricing concept, as well as using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loans. Projected future cash flows are calculated based upon contractual maturity or call dates, projected repayments, and prepayments of principal. Generally, for variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.\n \nImpaired Loans (Generally Carried at Fair Value)\n \nLoans for which the Corporation has measured impairment are generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The fair value consists of the loan balances less the valuation allowance and/or charge-offs.\n \nForeclosed Assets Held for Resale\n \nThe fair value of real estate acquired through foreclosure is based on independent third-party appraisals of the properties. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon appraisals that consider the sales prices of similar properties in the proximate vicinity.\n \nIt is the policy of the Corporation to have the initial market value of a foreclosed asset held for resale determined by an independent third-party valuation. If the Corporation already has a valid appraisal on file for the property and that appraisal has been completed within the previous 12 months, another appraisal shall not be required when the Corporation acquires ownership of that real estate. Further, the Corporation shall update the market value of each foreclosed asset with an independent third-party valuation at least every 18 months, or more frequently if management believes that there is an indication that the fair value has declined. These valuations may be adjusted downward to account for specialized use of the property, change in the condition of the real estate, change in local market and economic conditions, and other specific factors involving the collateral.\n \nRestricted Investment in Bank Stock (Carried at Cost)\n \nThe carrying amount of required and restricted investment in correspondent bank stock approximates fair value, and considers the limited marketability of such securities.\n \n31",

Mutual funds and equity securities include four common stock holdings that show unrealized losses which are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, at December 31, 2009.\nThese unrealized losses do not reflect deterioration in the credit worthiness of the companies, since they have adequate capital positions.  The unrealized losses on these temporarily impaired securities are primarily the result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities, changes in market spreads as a result of shifts in supply and demand, and/or changes in the level of prepayments for mortgage related securities. Since we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be until maturity for the debt securities, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010.\n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\n\nAt December 31, 2010 and 2009, mutual funds and equity securities included shares of one common stock that had been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired in 2009.  The common stock had a book value of $1,094 after the recognition of $375 in losses charged to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009. The approximate fair value for this security was $1,050 and $1,094 at December 31, 2010 and 2009.  ",

Mutual funds and equity securities include four common stock holdings that show unrealized losses which are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, at December 31, 2009.\nThese unrealized losses do not reflect deterioration in the credit worthiness of the companies, since they have adequate capital positions.  The unrealized losses on these temporarily impaired securities are primarily the result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities, changes in market spreads as a result of shifts in supply and demand, and/or changes in the level of prepayments for mortgage related securities. Since we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be until maturity for the debt securities, we do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010.\n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\n\nAt December 31, 2010 and 2009, mutual funds and equity securities included shares of one common stock that had been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired in 2009.  The common stock had a book value of $1,094 after the recognition of $375 in losses charged to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009. The approximate fair value for this security was $1,050 and $1,094 at December 31, 2010 and 2009.  '.",

Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the\nquarter, increased 36.5% as compared to the prior year quarter. This strong growth was partially influenced by an improvement in the global economy as compared to the prior year quarter, as well as year-end spending patterns in certain geographies.\nThe annual maintenance contracts that were sold with the new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous quarters, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 20.8%. Also contributing to this\ngrowth was an improvement in renewal rates, including the delayed renewal during the first quarter of 2010 of maintenance contracts that were previously due for renewal in 2009. Lease licenses and service revenue increased more modestly at 3.0% and\n2.6%, respectively.  With respect to revenue, on average for the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. Dollar was approximately 5.8% weaker,\nwhen measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the first quarter of 2009. The U.S. Dollar weakened against the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Swedish Krona, Canadian Dollar, Korean Won, Taiwan\nDollar and the Chinese Renminbi. The overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during the first quarter of 2010, as compared with the corresponding 2009 first quarter, of approximately $4.0 million and $1.9 million,\nrespectively.   \n20 \n\n\nTable of Contents\nA substantial portion of the Company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and\nmaintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new\nperpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts.  As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the\nCompany’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and\nmaintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely\naffected by economic or other factors, the Company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized. The Company generally invoices its customers\nup-front for lease licenses and maintenance contracts. As a result, the Company has no significant backlog of orders received but not invoiced. \nInternational and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 67.6% and 32.4%, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2010,\nand 67.3% and 32.7%, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  In valuing deferred revenue on the Ansoft balance sheet as\nof the acquisition date, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations. Although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the Company’s business or cash flow, the\nCompany’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, primarily for the first 12 months post-acquisition, was less than the sum of what would otherwise have been reported by Ansoft and ANSYS absent the\nacquisition.  Acquired deferred revenue of $7.5 million was recorded on the Ansoft opening balance sheet. This amount was approximately $23.5\nmillion lower than the historical carrying value. The impact on reported revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $500,000 for lease license revenue and $4.6 million for maintenance revenue; there was no meaningful impact for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2010.   \n21 \n\n\nTable of Contents\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit: \n ",

With respect to revenue, on average for the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. Dollar was approximately 5.8% weaker,\nwhen measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the first quarter of 2009. The U.S. Dollar weakened against the British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, Indian Rupee, Swedish Krona, Canadian Dollar, Korean Won, Taiwan\nDollar and the Chinese Renminbi. The overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during the first quarter of 2010, as compared with the corresponding 2009 first quarter, of approximately $4.0 million and $1.9 million,\nrespectively.   \n20 \n\n\nTable of Contents\nA substantial portion of the Company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and\nmaintenance contracts. These contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. In addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new\nperpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts.  As a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the\nCompany’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. To the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and\nmaintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth. Conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely\naffected by economic or other factors, the Company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized. The Company generally invoices its customers\nup-front for lease licenses and maintenance contracts. As a result, the Company has no significant backlog of orders received but not invoiced. \nInternational and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 67.6% and 32.4%, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2010,\nand 67.3% and 32.7%, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  In valuing deferred revenue on the Ansoft balance sheet as\nof the acquisition date, the Company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations. Although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the Company’s business or cash flow, the\nCompany’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, primarily for the first 12 months post-acquisition, was less than the sum of what would otherwise have been reported by Ansoft and ANSYS absent the\nacquisition.  Acquired deferred revenue of $7.5 million was recorded on the Ansoft opening balance sheet. This amount was approximately $23.5\nmillion lower than the historical carrying value. The impact on reported revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $500,000 for lease license revenue and $4.6 million for maintenance revenue; there was no meaningful impact for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2010.   \n21 \n\n\nTable of Contents\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit: \n '."

Perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the\nquarter, increased 36.5% as compared to the prior year quarter.

The board of directors considered, among other things, valuations of the Company’s common stock which were prepared by an independent third- party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2013 Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. After the completion of the IPO in July 2020, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on the date of grant on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nExpected Term—The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company’s historical share option exercise information is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points, and did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term for option grants is therefore determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). \nExpected Volatility—Because the Company does not have sufficient trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded life science companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on the similar size, stage in the life cycle, or area of specialty. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available and to align with the Company’s expected term.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option. \nDividend Yield—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock.

INVESTMENTSBasin Production and Completion LLC On February 9, 2022, we entered into an agreement to purchase all the series A-1 and B-1 preferred units of Basin Production and Completion LLC (“BPC”), for $46.0 million, consisting of $40.0 million to BPC for series A-1 and B-1 preferred units and $6.0 million to selling holders of BPC series B-1 preferred units. Additionally, on February 14, 2022, we made a loan to FHE USA LLC (“FHE”), a subsidiary of BPC for $1.25 million. The loan bears interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum. Interest is either paid at each calendar quarter end or added to the principal balance at the election of BPC. The loan matures on February 14, 2027. The total amount invested in BPC through February 9, 2022, was $51.4 million.Subsequent to February 9, 2022, our investments in BPC provide us the ability to have significant influence, but not control over BPC’s operations. BPC's business and affairs are managed under the direction of its board of directors, which we do not control. Based on our evaluation, we determined that BPC is a VIE, but we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We have elected the fair value option to account for our equity method investment in BPC. See “Note 14 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for more information on our instruments using Level 3 measurements. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of our investment in BPC was $23.4 million.\n91\n\nTable of ContentsProFrac Holding Corp.

The increase in gross margin was offset\nby higher SG&A and R&D allocations to support the growth and integration required in AMSC Power Systems with the recent acquisitions of Windtec and PQS.

The increase is a result of a $0.9 million inventory write-off for a SuperVAR synchronous condenser, an asset impairment charge of $0.6 million related to the 1G assets held for sale, and $0.2\nmillion of restructuring charges for a reduction in workforce related the March 2007 AMSC Wires and SuperMachines re-alignment into the AMSC Superconductors business unit. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in the\namount of SG&A and R&D allocations to the business unit as a result of the re-alignment of the business in March 2007.  Non-operating\nexpenses/Interest income  Interest income decreased to $0.3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2007 from $0.7 million in the\nsame quarter of the prior year. This decrease in interest income reflects the lower cash balances available for investment compared to the first quarter of the prior year. We expect to realize an increase in interest income for the fiscal year\nending March 31, 2008 compared with the prior year as a result of the additional $94.3 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering expenses) we received in the recent stock\noffering completed on July 25, 2007.  Other income (expense), net, was $(1.0) million in the quarter ended June 30, 2007 compared\nto an immaterial amount in the same quarter of the prior year and consisted primarily of a loss on the revaluation of the stock warrant issued in April 2005 to TM Capital Corp., a past financial advisor to us, related to a litigation settlement. The\nlitigation settlement amount of $2.7 million, which consisted of a $1.7 million cash payment made in April 2005 and a $1.0 million accrued liability relating to the warrant issued for 200,000 shares of our common stock, was accrued in the fourth\nquarter of the year ended March 31, 2005. The accrued warrant cost will continue to be classified as a current liability in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments\nIndexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock” until such time as the warrant is exercised or forfeited, and will be marked to market based primarily on the current price and expected volatility of our common stock as of\nthe end of each reporting period. The warrant was re-valued at $2.4 million as of June 30, 2007, resulting in a loss of $1.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.  Income Taxes  During the quarter ended June 30, 2007, we recorded income tax expense of $0.3\nmillion primarily related to foreign taxes. Based on our latest operating plan, we expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least the end of the year ending March 31, 2009 as we continue to devote significant financial resources\nto our commercialization efforts and to our ongoing research and development activities.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  The Company approved the 2010 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (2010 Plan) in September 2010 to replace the 2004 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan. The 2010 Plan provided for the granting of stock options and restricted stock awards. The 2010 Plan terminated upon the Company’s initial public offering in May 2014. However, grants made under the 2010 Plan are still governed by that plan. As of December 31, 2021, options to purchase 398,547 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.52 per share remained outstanding under the 2010 Plan. The Company approved the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan in October 2013. The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan became effective immediately on adoption. The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan was amended in June 2016 and June 2018, (Amended 2013 Plan). The Amended 2013 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, stock units, and performance cash awards to certain employees, members of the board of directors and consultants of the Company. On January 1 of each year the aggregate number of common shares that may be issued under the Amended 2013 Plan shall automatically increase by a number of shares equal to the lower of (a) 6% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last calendar day of the prior fiscal year, or (b) a number of shares of common stock determined by the Company’s board of directors. As of December 31, 2021, options to purchase 4,224,323 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $7.23 per share and 501,255 shares of common stock underlying restricted stock units remained outstanding under the Amended 2013 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, there were 3,044,303 shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended 2013 Plan. As of January 1, 2022, the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the Amended 2013 Plan was automatically increased by 3,485,526 shares, increasing the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Amended 2013 Plan to 6,529,829. In 2019 and 2020, the Company granted performance cash awards. The performance cash awards vest in four annual installments from the date of grant and entitle the employees to receive a cash payment, on the earlier of (i) four years from the date of grant or (ii) a change of control, equal in value to the amount by which the then value of the Company’s common stock exceeds the base value. As of December 31, 2021, $0.4 million was accrued as compensation expense for vested performance cash awards.The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.

Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties.\n\n\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our products. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our technology.\n\n\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property, including know-how or trade secrets, of a third party, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\n\n\nMany of our employees, consultants and contractors were previously employed at or engaged by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and contractors do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information or know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, and do not perform work for us that is in conflict with their obligations to another employer or any other entity, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees, consultants and contractors have used or disclosed such intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, an employee, advisor or consultant who performs work for us may have obligations to a third party that are in conflict with their obligations to us, and as a result such third party may claim an ownership interest in the intellectual property arising out of work performed for us. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, or access to consultants and contractors. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n\n\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n\nOur stock price may be volatile and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid. \n\n\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.

These adjustments and any resulting adjustments to\nthe statements of operations were not material to the Company’s previously reported operating results or financial position.  Factors\ncontributing to the purchase price that resulted in the goodwill (which is not tax deductible) include the acquisition of management, sales, and technology personnel with the skills to market new and existing products of the Company, enhanced global\nproduct capabilities, and complementary products and customers.  The pro forma financial information in the table below presents the combined\nhistorical results of the combined Company as if the acquisition had occurred January 1, 2011 (in thousands, except per share data). The pro forma information is shown for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of future\nresults of operations of the Company or results of operations of the Company that would have actually occurred had the transactions been in effect for the periods presented. This pro forma information is not intended to represent or be indicative of\nactual results had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of each period, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results and does not reflect potential synergies, integration costs, or other such costs or savings. Certain pro forma\nadjustments have been made to net income (loss) for three months and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 to give effect to estimated adjustments to expenses to remove the amortization on eliminated S1 historical identifiable\nintangible assets and added amortization expense for the value of identified intangibles acquired in the acquisition (primarily acquired software, customer relationships, trade names, and covenants not to compete), adjustments to interest expense to\nreflect the elimination of preexisting S1 debt and added estimated interest expense on the Company’s Term Credit Facility and additional borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and to eliminate share-based compensation expense for\neliminated positions. Additionally, certain one-time transaction expenses that are a direct result of the acquisition have been excluded from the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. \n '.",

(See Note 10, “Debt,” for additional information regarding the Loan and Security Agreement.) In conjunction with this agreement, the Company issued the First Warrant to purchase 13,927 shares of the Company’s common stock. The First Warrant was exercisable at any time after its issuance and had an expiration date of December 5, 2017, at an initial exercise price equal to $35.90 per share subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments.  The exercise price was reduced to $19.50 per share in conjunction with entering into the New Term Loan B.  An anti-dilution adjustment from the sale of 909,090 units, each consisting of one share of common stock and 0.90 of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock, to Hudson Bay Capital (See Note 12, “Stockholders Equity”), resulted in a reduction of the exercise price to $17.00 per share on November 13, 2014.  The Hercules Second Amendment resulted in the cancellation of the First Warrant on December 19, 2014.\nThe Company accounted for the First Warrant as a liability due to certain provisions within the warrant. The First Warrant was subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value was recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives and warrants until the warrant was cancelled on December 19, 2014. \nFollowing is a summary of the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the First Warrant: \n ",

The First Warrant was exercisable at any time after its issuance and had an expiration date of December 5, 2017, at an initial exercise price equal to $35.90 per share subject to certain price-based and other anti-dilution adjustments.  The exercise price was reduced to $19.50 per share in conjunction with entering into the New Term Loan B.  An anti-dilution adjustment from the sale of 909,090 units, each consisting of one share of common stock and 0.90 of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock, to Hudson Bay Capital (See Note 12, “Stockholders Equity”), resulted in a reduction of the exercise price to $17.00 per share on November 13, 2014.  The Hercules Second Amendment resulted in the cancellation of the First Warrant on December 19, 2014.\nThe Company accounted for the First Warrant as a liability due to certain provisions within the warrant. The First Warrant was subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value was recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives and warrants until the warrant was cancelled on December 19, 2014. \nFollowing is a summary of the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the First Warrant: \n '."

DHS is expected to invest up to a total of $29.0 million in the development of a new HTS power grid technology called\nFaultBlocker™ cable systems. FaultBlockerTM cable\nsystems are designed to utilize customized Amperium™ HTS wires, and ancillary controls to deliver more power through the grid while also being able to suppress power surges that can disrupt service. On July 8, 2013, DHS committed an\nadditional $8.6 million in funding on Project HYDRA. DHS has now committed 100% of the total expected funding for this project.

Project HYDRA is a project with\nConsolidated Edison, Inc. which is being partially funded by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). DHS is expected to invest up to a total of $29.0 million in the development of a new HTS power grid technology called\nFaultBlocker™ cable systems. FaultBlockerTM cable\nsystems are designed to utilize customized Amperium™ HTS wires, and ancillary controls to deliver more power through the grid while also being able to suppress power surges that can disrupt service. On July 8, 2013, DHS committed an\nadditional $8.6 million in funding on Project HYDRA. DHS has now committed 100% of the total expected funding for this project. Consolidated Edison and Southwire Company are our subcontractors on this project.

Increased net income from these items was partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in income tax expense.\n \nResults of Operations\n \nSoftware Licenses. Software licenses were previously included as a component of a revenue category we called “Product Sales.” Software licenses consist of revenue from the sale of software licenses for biometrics and imaging, and DSL service assurance applications.\n \nSoftware license revenue increased 34% from $2.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012 to $3.8 million in the same three month period in 2013.  As a percentage of total revenue, software license revenue increased from 58% in the first quarter of 2012 to 68% in the current year quarter. The dollar increase in software license revenue was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in revenue from the sale of biometrics and imaging software, which was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in revenue from the sale of DSL service assurance software.\n \nThe increase in biometrics and imaging licenses sales was primarily due to the following factors: i) a large license sale to a U.S. government agency; ii) higher international license sales; and iii) strong license sales to OEM customers.

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the $17.6 million increase in provision for income taxes is due to current net earnings.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had $1,022.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, comprising $790.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $231.7 million in marketable securities. The increase of $299.3 million since December 31, 2021, was primarily from cash flow from operations and driven by the receipt of accounts receivable relating to royalties from bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab in the six months ended June 30, 2022. \nWe have generated positive operating cash flow cumulatively since our inception in 2012 and in every year since 2018. We intend to significantly invest in our business, and as a result may incur operating losses in future periods. We will continue to invest in research and development efforts towards expanding our capabilities and expertise along our technology stack, the building of our business development team and marketing our solutions to new and existing partners, and the expansion of our future office headquarters, and related infrastructure, including execution of long-term office-lease arrangements. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and do not anticipate the need of external funding over at least the next 36 months following the date of this report.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\n '.",

Deferred revenues are recognized as revenues when the related services are performed for the client. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022 were $3.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of December 31, 2021 were $1.4 million and $29.2 million, respectively.\n2. Divestitures and Acquisitions2023 DivestituresDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a loss on the sale of businesses of $17.5 million, as a component of “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The Company determined that the sale of the businesses did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. The Company received $12.8 million of proceeds, which are net of transaction fees and holdbacks.2022 AcquisitionsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company acquired two sales businesses and two marketing businesses. The acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. As such, the purchase consideration for each acquired business was allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination were recorded on the Company’s financial statements as of the acquisition date based upon the estimated fair value at such date. The excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of each acquired business have been included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) since its respective date of acquisition.The aggregate purchase price for the acquisitions referenced above was $75.5 million, which includes $74.1 million paid in cash, $0.5 million recorded as contingent consideration liabilities, and $0.8 million recorded as holdback amounts. Contingent consideration payments are determined based on future financial performance and  9\n payment obligations (as defined in the applicable purchase agreement) and are recorded at fair value. The maximum potential payment outcome related to the acquisitions is $1.6 million. Holdback amounts are used to withhold a portion of the initial purchase price payment until certain post-closing conditions are satisfied and are typically settled within 18 months of the acquisition. The goodwill related to the acquisitions represented the value paid for the assembled workforce, geographic presence, and expertise. Of the resulting goodwill relating to these acquisitions, $0.8 million is deductible for tax purposes. The Company acquired a 70% ownership interest in one acquisition, which also includes a put option exercisable by each of the 12% and 18% noncontrolling interest holders that allows the 12% holder to sell its 12% noncontrolling interest to the Company, and the 18% holder to sell 8% of its noncontrolling interest to Company, for a multiple of the acquired subsidiary’s adjusted earnings. As the put option is outside of the Company’s control, the estimated value of the 20% noncontrolling interest is presented as a redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of permanent equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquisitions completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as of the applicable acquisition dates, are as follows:  ",

Management bases its estimate on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances including the negotiation of an equitable adjustment on the Cargo\nMission Contract (“CMC”) contract which was added to the contract as a pricing amendment due to the delay in the return to flight of the space shuttle. Costs to complete include, when appropriate, material, labor, subcontracting costs,\nlease costs, commissions, insurance and depreciation. Our business segment personnel perform periodic contract status and performance reviews.

Revenue\nRecognition    Our business units’ revenue is derived primarily from\nlong-term contracts with the U.S. Government, U.S. Government contractors, and commercial customers. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using the methods described below. Estimating future costs and, therefore, revenues and profits is a\nprocess requiring management judgment. Management bases its estimate on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances including the negotiation of an equitable adjustment on the Cargo\nMission Contract (“CMC”) contract which was added to the contract as a pricing amendment due to the delay in the return to flight of the space shuttle. Costs to complete include, when appropriate, material, labor, subcontracting costs,\nlease costs, commissions, insurance and depreciation. Our business segment personnel perform periodic contract status and performance reviews. In the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit, the cumulative effect of such change\nis recorded in the period that the change in estimate occurs.    A Summary of Revenue Recognition Methods Follows:   '.",

At June 30, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents of $26.4 million and our net working capital was approximately $52.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately $12.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2023, due to funding our continuing operating expenses, purchases of short-term time deposit investments, purchases of R&D equipment and expansion of our facility, share buyback program and the Delaware Litigation Settlement payment.\n \nOperating Activities\n \nNet cash used in operating activities was $7.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to cash used in operating activities of $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. This increase was caused by an increase in operating expenses, increase in inventory as we secure hard to source electrical components, payment of the Stein Action settlement, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and depreciation related to the increase in R&D equipment.\n \nInvesting Activities\n \nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased $3.2 million, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.

This was due to repayment of related party debt (see below).\n \nRelated-party Debt\n \nOn September 5, 2019, the Company entered into a private placement transaction with Thomas B. Pickens III, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, for the issuance and sale of a secured promissory note to Mr. Pickens with a principal amount of $1.5 million (the “2019 Note”), and on February 13, 2020, the Company entered into a second private placement transaction with Mr. Pickens for the issuance and sale of a second secured promissory note to Mr. Pickens with a principal amount of $1.0 million (the “2020 Note” and, collectively with the 2019 Note, the “Original Notes”). Interest on the Original Notes accrued at 11% per annum. The principal amount and accrued interest on the Original Notes originally were to become due and payable on September 5, 2020; however, on August 24, 2020, the Company and Mr. Pickens agreed to extend the date of maturity of the Original Notes and payment of accrued interest to September 5, 2021 (the “Extended Maturity Date”). The Company had the option to prepay the principal amount and all accrued interest on the Original Notes at any time prior to the Extended Maturity Date.\n \nIn connection with the issuance of the Original Notes, the Company, along with 1st Detect Corporation and Astrotech Technologies, Inc. (the “Subsidiaries”), entered into two security agreements, dated as of September 5, 2019 and February 13, 2020 (collectively, the “Original Security Agreements”), with Mr. Pickens, pursuant to which the Company and the Subsidiaries granted to Mr. Pickens a security interest in all of the Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ Collateral, as such term is defined in the Original Security Agreements. In addition, the Subsidiaries jointly and severally agreed to guarantee and act as surety for the Company’s obligation to repay the Original Notes pursuant to a subsidiary guarantee.\n ",

These financial covenants are applicable to the results of ASO. In the event\nwe are not in compliance with a covenant, the bank may, among other things, accelerate all outstanding borrowings, cease extending\ncredit or foreclose on collateral. As of March 31, 2014, we were not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio and minimum\ntangible net worth debt covenants.

LeasesOperating leasesThe Company has made certain assumptions and judgements when applying ASC 842, the Company elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases (lease terms of twelve months or less). Operating lease arrangements primarily consist of office, warehouse and test house leases expiring during different years through 2025.

Since the implicit rate of such leases is unknown and we may not be reasonably certain to renew leases, the Company has elected to apply a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to facility leases on the original lease term in calculating the present value of future lease payments.

The Company used the closing market price of $0.38 per share at September 30, 2017, to determine the aggregate intrinsic value.\n \n2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n \nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under which eligible employees are permitted to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. Initially 500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance, which is subject to an automatic increase on the first day of each fiscal year, commencing in 2016, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 493,000 shares (ii) 1.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or (iii) an amount as determined by the Board of Directors. For fiscal 2017, the common stock available for issuance under the ESPP was increased by 356,640 shares of common stock. The price of the common stock purchased will be the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of an offering period or at the end of a purchase period. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The first offering under the ESPP began in February 2015. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 801,138 shares of common stock remained reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The Company incurred $15,000 and $94,000 in stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, and $105,000 and $311,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \n15'.",

The increase in headcount, consulting and \n38\n\nfacility related costs relates to additional resources required in support of our expanding research and development programs, as well as rent associated with our leasing of additional office and lab space.  We expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods in support of the Phase 3 programs and other studies and our pipeline development.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $12.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $11.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily due to an increase in costs to support our research and development programs, including headcount and compensation-related costs, and associated facility-related costs partially offset by lower commercial planning costs and patent related costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, was $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is primarily comprised of interest income.  \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nWe have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception in February 2007, and as of June 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $363.2 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.\nWe have funded our operations principally through sales of our common stock and payments received from our collaboration partners. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately $321.2 million.  Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Accordingly, available for sale securities, consisting principally of corporate and government debt securities stated at fair value, are also available as a source of liquidity.  \nCash Flows \nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below: \n ",

We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nIn July 2020, we completed our initial public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1. In the initial public offering, we issued and sold an aggregate of 9,775,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters’ exercise in full of their overallotment option, under the registration statement at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $172.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $13.0 million and before deducting offering-related expenses. We believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering of $172.7 million, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2023. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
